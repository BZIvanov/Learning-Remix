## About the demo

This is the same app from the official documentation [here](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/tutorials/jokes).

This demo contains only the essential files. Config files which were not changed were removed to keep this demo simple in terms of code and files. If you want to run it just copy paste the files in a newly created project.

## Database

Check the scripts in package.json file on how to generate the database and seed some data. For this example we are using file based database.
